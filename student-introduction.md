# Róbert Leó Jónsson: Written Student Introduction

My name is Róbert Leó Jónsson, and I'm 23 years old. 

I am an only child, born and raised here in the capital area of Iceland and have never lived anywhere else. 

My mother is a scientist (specifically a chemist), and it was just me and her for most of my childhood. She completely infected me with the scientific worldview. She taught me to read at a very early age. I knew the order of the planets before I knew the names of the weekdays. And she always encouraged me to think for myself. 

I like to think it is thanks to her that I have always had a strong sense of excitement for science and rational thinking.

In spite of that, I was never a good student in school. I think it's because I have a strong disdain for authority. However, I always had good grades in the sciences --especially mathematics-- as they always came quite naturally to me. But I never gave it much effort, and was always quite a troublesome student.

I'm a bit obsessive when I decide I want to achieve something, I'll get a singular focus on pursuing that goal. 

In elementary school, I enjoyed chess, and wanted to become the best. And I became one of the best young chess players in the country. 

When I was around fifteen years old, I wanted to get in shape, and get muscular. Less than two years later, I could probably have competed in a fitness competition with people in their twenties.

In my third year of high school, I acquired my current, and most ambitious obsession. I was reading Yuval Noah Harari's book *Homo Deus*. In this book, Yuval describes the state of the art in artificial intelligence, and makes informed speculations about the part it might play in the future. And I fell in love.

There are few things more interesting than the ability to reason, and make intelligent decisions. And that's not to speak of issues of consciousness, which I am sure will enter the picture at some point in time. It's also not an inconsequential field that is mostly just intellectually interesting. The creation of real artificial intelligence will probably be the most significant even in the history of humanity, for better or worse.

This was what I wanted to work on. And that's what I've been doing ever since.

I figured out that I needed to be skilled at mathematics. So I bought textbooks, and worked on them in my free time. I got perfect grades in mathematics for the rest of my high school education, and received a mathematics award when I graduated. I taught myself programming, and took multiple online courses on machine learning.

The obvious next step was to go to university. I am now in my last semester in my bachelor's degree in discrete mathematics and computer science.

The story has just begun, and it's the most exciting journey I could imagine.
